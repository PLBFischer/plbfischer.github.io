# AI for Science & Biology  
### Bridging Physics, Machine Learning, and Computational Biology  

I'm Paolo — I build generative AI models for protein engineering, cellular dynamics, and biological design. My background spans physics, numerical simulation, mathematical modeling, and deep learning applied to real biological systems.
